# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
# ===================================================================
usage_instructions:
  purpose: |
    This registry serves as a reference during discovery conversations.
    It helps identify potential integrations that could enhance features.

  how_to_use: |
    1. During discovery, identify the application type
    2. Reference relevant integration categories
    3. Ask users about specific integrations that could enhance their features
    4. Record only user-confirmed integrations in discovery.json

  important_notes: |
    - Don't automatically suggest all integrations
    - Use this as a conversation guide, not a checklist
    - Focus on integrations that solve real user problems
    - In INSTANT mode, only include explicitly mentioned integrations
    - In other modes, explore based on user interest
