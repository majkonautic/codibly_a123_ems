## Module Technology Recommendations

### Database Evolution
- Current: SQLite (development only)
- Recommended: PostgreSQL for transactional data
- Time-series: TimescaleDB for performance metrics
- Cache: Redis for real-time data

### API Architecture
- Current: Next.js API routes (monolithic)
- Recommended: Separate API service with OpenAPI spec
- Consider: GraphQL for complex data relationships

### Real-time Infrastructure
- Current: Socket.io (adequate for current scale)
- Future: Apache Kafka for event streaming at scale
- Consider: WebSocket API Gateway for better scaling

## Module Security Considerations

- **authentication**: Implement MFA, session management, audit logging
- **assets**: Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- **alerts**: Rate limiting for alert generation
- **reports**: Data access controls and export audit trails
- **api**: Rate limiting, API key management, OAuth2 for external access
